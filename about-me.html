    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up, I have always been memorized by photography. My mother is a
      photographer, too. Wherever we went, we took pictures. We’ve gotten in
      trouble with countless restaurants because the flash bothered the people
      around! I don’t remember a time where I didn’t have a camera. They started
      out small, but as time went on, they got better and better! Canon cameras
      are my personal favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was 10 years old, my mom signed me up for my first photography
      camp. I’d never taken my camera out of auto mode before then, but I
      learned so much about the basics. It blew my little mind. From then on,
      I’d take photo classes at all the camps and institution’s I attended.
      Little by little, I built up a repertoire of knowledge. Most recently, I
      took a photo class at my university. It made me remember how much I loved
      the art. Now, I never want to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days you can find me having photo shoots with my best friends,
      throwing cloths into the air and jumping into the pool for the perfect
      shot.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <p>
      When shooting, I love to explore long exposures and close ups. A lot of
      the time, I set up a tripod, or just put my camera on my desk, and turn
      the lights on and off, dim them down, and run all around my room! This
      helps me get myself in many parts of the frame. (More info on how to at
      <a href="DIY-photo-shoots.html">Home Photoshoots!</a>) Other times I play
      with the zoom and focus when exploring this setting with others as my
      model. Lately, I’ve loved the use of props. Make up, flowers,
      sheets—basically anything I can get my hands on! I love to make the
      ordinary look extremely funky!
