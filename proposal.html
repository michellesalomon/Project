      <li>My website explores elements of photography.</li>
      <li>
        This website will be important because it will not only be a place to
        showcase my own art, but also a place to give aspiring artists tips and
        tricks on how to improve. It will highlight the photographing as well as
        photo editing.
      </li>
      <li>
        My target audience is photo enthusiasts who are looking for inspiration
        for photo shoots and edits.
      </li>
      <li>
        I expect to create an about me page ; a photo library of my own work;
        DIY phot shoot ideas with external links to in depth instructional
        videos; instructions on how to achieve certain aesthetics with editing.
