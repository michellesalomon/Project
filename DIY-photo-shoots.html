    <h1>DIY Photo Shoots</h1>
    <p>
      There are many ways to get creative at home. You don't need fancy studios
      or expensive props to make amazing photographs! Here, I'll walk you
      through some of my recent home shoots, and detail ideas for future shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, for this photo, <i>Serenity</i>, [bath.png] my friend and I went
      to a craft shop, bought plastic plants, and filled a bath tub with things
      we found in the house! We threw in a little Epson salt to give it that
      blue color and photographed the tub as the color spread.

      Next, these pictures were made experimenting with long exposures. An easy
      way to begin is by setting your camera to shutter priority. Play around
      with the light with lamps, flashlights, cell phones, and even TV screens.
      Turn the lights on and off. See what happens! Then experiment staying
      still, walking around, only moving a hand or the head. Move objects
      around, zoom in and out. Mix and match to watch magic happen.

      This picture was accomplished by jumping in the pool! Sometimes you just
      have to go for it and see what happens. Think about your makeup! Here,
      mine was colorful yest simple, but imagine the potential of color on the
      face and how it can reacts with the water. (Send me what you come up
      with!)

      Walking around your life, I challenge you to focus on sidewalks and
      reflections. If the placement of the world feels poetic, snap a photo. Go
      out after a rainy day. That's how I got this reflection! You can also
      bring reflective surfaces outside and see how it reacts to the sun.
